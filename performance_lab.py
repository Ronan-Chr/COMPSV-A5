# 🔍 Problem 1: Find Most Frequent Element
# Given a list of integers, return the value that appears most frequently.
# If there's a tie, return any of the most frequent.
#
# Example:
# Input: [1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 3]
# Output: 3

def most_frequent(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        return None #in case there are no numbers

    counts = {}
    best_value = numbers[0]
    best_count = 0

    for num in numbers:
        counts[num] = counts.get(num, 0) + 1
        if counts[num] > best_count:
            best_count = counts[num]
            best_value = num
    return best_value

"""
Time and Space Analysis for problem 1:
- Best-case: O(n) - when all elements are unique so it is counted, its hard to predict without the entire list itll beused on.
- Worst-case: O(n) - one pass through the list to count frequencies. The dictionary lookups are O(1) on average.
- Average-case:O(n)
- Space complexity: O(k) where k is the number of unique elements in the list if every value is unique.
- Why this approach? This approach uses a dictionary to count the frequency of each element in a single pass which is efficient and straightforward compared to a loop or any alternative.
- Could it be optimized? Im pretty sure this is the best it gets I know theres certain edge cases where the way the data is interpreted could affect performance, but overall this is efficient.
- Trade offs? The trade-off is that we use extra space to store the counts in the dictionary but this allows us to achieve O(n) time complexity.
